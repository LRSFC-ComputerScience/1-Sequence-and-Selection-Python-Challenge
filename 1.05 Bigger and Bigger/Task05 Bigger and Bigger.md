# [Programming Challenges](../README.md)

## 1.5 Bigger and Bigger

Design and implement a program that allows the user to enter 3 numbers in any order.

The program displays the largest number.

## Computational thinking

Using Computational thinking (CT) plan how you will solve this problem; first by filling in the **IPDO** table then by creating an algorithm using either Pseudocode or a Flowchart.

### IPDO table

Use the IPDO table to decide on what data needs to be Input, Output, How the input will need to be PROCESSED to get the required output.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **INPUT** | **PROCESS** |
| Add inputs here: | Add processes here: |
| **DECISIONS** | **OUTPUT** |
| Add any decisions here: | Add outputs here: |

</br>

### Pseudocode/Flowchart

Psuedocode here:

```text

```

Or

1. Create a flowchart using draw.io link: <https://app.diagrams.net/>
2. store the image on a shared area:
   - [I recommend imgur <https://imgur.com/>
3. then add your image link here:

## Variables and Other Data Structures

| Name | Datatype | Typical Value | Minimum Value | Maximum Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

</br></br>

## Test Plan

Complete the first 2 columns of the following Test Plan BEFORE implementation. Add your own tests to the blank lines.

| Inputs | Expected Output | Actual Outputs | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|2, 9, 3 |  |  |  |
|100, 4, 47 |  |  |  |
|4.2, 1.8, 5 |  |  |  |
|1, 0, -1 |  |  |  |
|5, 8, 5 |  |  |  |

## Implement your program!

## Testing

Use the table above to identify any issues with your program

What is the purpose of the 5th test in the test plan?

### Code

Use the attached files to write your code in:

- Python:

>bigger_and_bigger.py

### Commiting your code

Add a comment to explain what you have done, for example:
