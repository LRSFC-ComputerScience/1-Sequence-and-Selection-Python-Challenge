# [Programming Challenges](../README.md)

## 2. Hello User

Design and implement a program that allows the user to enter his/her name.

When run, the program displays “Hello user”, where user is the name entered.

## Computational thinking

Using Computational thinking (CT) plan how you will solve this problem; first by filling in the **IPDO** table then by creating an algorithm using either Pseudocode or a Flowchart.

### IPDO table

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **INPUT** | **PROCESS** |
| Add inputs here: | Add processes here: |
| **DECISIONS** | **OUTPUT** |
| Add any decisions here: | Add outputs here: |

</br>

### Pseudocode/Flowchart

Psuedocode here:

```text
Pseudocode here:

```

Or

1. Create a flowchart using draw.io link: <https://app.diagrams.net/>
2. store the image on a shared area:
   - [I recommend imgur <https://imgur.com/>
3. then add your image link here:

![Flowchart here](https://imgur.com/d6k15I4.png)

## Variables and Other Data Structures

| Name | Datatype | Typical Value | Minimum Value | Maximum Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

</br></br>

## Explain these terms

```text
Textbox:

Property:

String:

Concatenation:

```
