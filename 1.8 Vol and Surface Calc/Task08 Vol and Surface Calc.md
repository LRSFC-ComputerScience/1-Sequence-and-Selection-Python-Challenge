## 1.8 Volume and Surface Calc

Design and implement a program that allows the user to enter 3 numbers representing the height, width and length of a cuboid.

The program calculates and displays the volume and total surface area of the cuboid.

## Computational thinking

Using Computational thinking (CT) plan how you will solve this problem; first by filling in the **IPDO** table then by creating an algorithm using either Pseudocode or a Flowchart.

### IPDO table

Use the IPDO table to decide on what data needs to be Input, Output, How the input will need to be PROCESSED to get the required output.

Also does anything need to be stored when the program is not running?

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **INPUT** | **PROCESS** |
| Add inputs here: | Add processes here: |
| **DECISIONS** | **OUTPUT** |
| Add any decisions here: | Add outputs here: |

</br>

### Pseudocode/Flowchart

Psuedocode here:

```text


```

Or

1. Create a flowchart using draw.io link: <https://app.diagrams.net/>
2. store the image on a shared area:
   - [I recommend imgur <https://imgur.com/>
3. then add your image link here:

## Variables and Other Data Structures

| Name | Datatype | Typical Value | Minimum Value | Maximum Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Test Plan

Complete the first 2 columns of the following Test Plan BEFORE implementation. Add your own tests to the blank lines.

| Inputs | Expected Output | Actual Outputs | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|2, 2, 2 |  |  |  |
3, 3, 3 |  |  |  |
2.5, 3, 4 |  |  |  |
4, 6, 8 |  |  |  |
4, 8, 8 |  |  |  |
3, 0, 3 |  |  |  |

## Implement your program!

## Testing

Use the table above to identify any issues with your program

What is the purpose of the 3th and 6th tests in the test plan?
