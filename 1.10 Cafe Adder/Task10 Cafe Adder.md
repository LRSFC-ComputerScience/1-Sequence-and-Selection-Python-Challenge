## 1.10. Café Adder

Design and implement a program that allows the user to create the bill for a café.

The user can enter the name and price for up to 5 items and how many were ordered.

- If the order is to take-out, 20% VAT is added.
- If the customer is a pensioner, a 10% discount is applied.

The program displays an appropriate bill/receipt.

## Computational thinking

Using Computational thinking (CT) plan how you will solve this problem; first by filling in the **IPDO** table then by creating an algorithm using either Pseudocode or a Flowchart.

### IPDO table

Use the IPDO table to decide on what data needs to be Input, Output, How the input will need to be PROCESSED to get the required output.

Also does anything need to be stored when the program is not running?

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **INPUT** | **PROCESS** |
| Add inputs here: | Add processes here: |
| **DECISIONS** | **OUTPUT** |
| Add any decisions here: | Add outputs here: |

</br>

### Pseudocode/Flowchart

Psuedocode here:

```text


```

Or

1. Create a flowchart using draw.io link: <https://app.diagrams.net/>
2. store the image on a shared area:
   - [I recommend imgur <https://imgur.com/>
3. then add your image link here:

## Variables and Other Data Structures

| Name | Datatype | Typical Value | Minimum Value | Maximum Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

</br></br>

## Test Plan

Complete the first 2 columns of the following Test Plan BEFORE implementation.

Add your own tests to the blank lines.

| Inputs | Expected Output | Actual Outputs | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|Coffee, £2, 2</br>Cake £1.50, 2 |  |  |  |
|Coffee, £2, 2</br>Cake £1.50, 2</br>Take-out |  |  |  |
|Coffee, £2, 2</br>Cake £1.50, 2</br>Pensioner |  |  |  |
| |  |  |  |
| |  |  |  |

## Implement your program!

### Hint:

It is very easy to over-complicate this one. Don't!

You could give an option as to the variety of items and their prices.

You might choose to use check-boxes for Take-Away and Pensioner inputs

You might choose to use an array or you might not!

## Testing

Use the table above to identify any issues with your program

The test data has values such as “£2” and “£1.50”? Why are these not correct in reality?

```text

```

### Code

Use the attached files to write your code in:

- Python:
